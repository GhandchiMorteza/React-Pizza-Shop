# Fast React Pizza App

Welcome to the Fast React Pizza App repository! This application is designed to offer a seamless experience for customers wishing to order pizza from the comfort of their home. Built with React, this front-end project interfaces with an existing backend API to fetch the pizza menu and handle orders.

## Features

- **Dynamic Pizza Menu**: Customers can browse an up-to-date menu loaded dynamically from a backend API.
- **User-Friendly Ordering Process**: No login required. Users simply enter their name to start ordering.
- **Shopping Cart Functionality**: Allows adding multiple pizzas to a cart before placing an order.
- **Order Customization**: Users can provide delivery details (name, phone number, address) and opt for GPS location sharing for easier delivery.
- **Priority Orders**: Option to mark orders as priority for faster delivery at an additional cost of 20% of the cart price.
- **Order Tracking**: Each order is assigned a unique ID, which can be used by customers to check their order status.
- **Post-Order Priority Marking**: Flexibility to mark orders as priority even after they have been placed.
- **Payment on Delivery**: Designed for convenience, the application requires no online payment processing.
